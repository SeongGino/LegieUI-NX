# LegieUI - NX Version
v0.81 (12/08/2019)
---
To install, extract the LegieUI_Grid folder to `~/home/.esoteric/skins/`.

This pack is targeted for 350teric ver. 12/04/2019 or newer.

This skin is made exclusively for 350teric's (default) grid mode, when using more than one column of links. The background design is not made for list mode, so please keep this in mind!

This pack currently aims to *loosely* emulate the feel of the original menu interfaces used in the PlayStation 2 GOAT JRPG, Tales of Legendia.

Legendia is unique amongst the series (or at least, what little we Yanks got in NA) for presenting a full-screen interface using bold burgandy/gold sillouette'd icons. Doesn't sound all that special, but considering the genre-typical interfaces from Symphonia-backwards, it's certainly a breath of fresh air. Sadly, no bombastic orchestra tunes comes with this skin.

The skin is about 80% complete based on its original concept, with the only thing lost being custom link icons. I intended to make thematically appropriate icons made for at least the basic system items, but laziness/not being a graphic design major caused it to get shoved aside while getting the essentials right. While I plan to do this for the system category, there are no guarantees for apps/emus/games as there's WAY too friggin many to account for.
